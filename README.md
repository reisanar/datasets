 Variables    |  Description
------------  |----------------------------------------------------------------
`City`      | Name of City
`Cost of Living Index`        | Cost of Living Index is a relative indicator of consumer goods prices, including groceries, restaurants, transportation and utilities. Does not include accommodation expenses such as rent or mortgage. If a city has a Cost of Living Index of 120, it means [Numbeo](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/) estimates it is 20% more expensive than New York (excluding rent).
`Rent Index` | Estimation of prices of renting apartments in the city compared to New York City. If Rent index is 80, Numbeo estimates that price of rents in that city is on an average 20% less than the price in New York.
`Cost of Living Plus Rent Index`  | Estimation of consumer goods prices including rent comparing to New York City
`Groceries Index`      | Estimation of grocery prices in the city compared to New York City
`Restaurant Price Index`        | Comparison of prices of meals and drinks in restaurants and bars compared to NYC
`Local Purchasing Power Index`| Shows relative purchasing power in buying goods and services in a given city for the average wage in that city. If domestic purchasing power is 40, this means that the inhabitants of that city with the average salary can afford to buy on an average 60% less goods and services than New York City residents with an average salary.

  [`all_billboard_summer_hits`](https://github.com/reisanar/datasets/blob/master/all_billboard_summer_hits.csv)
  </summary> Songs that were part of the Billboard Summer Hits list from 1958 to 2017. Dataset includes music features as provided by the Spotify API, including the "acousticness" and "danceability" of the song, and measurements of valence, tempo, among other audio features. A description of the features can be found at <https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/>
  
 Variables    |  Description
------------  |----------------------------------------------------------------
`danceability`      | 	Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable. 
`energy`        | 	Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy. 
`key` | 	The estimated overall key of the track. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation . E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, 2 = D, and so on. If no key was detected, the value is -1.
`loudness`  | 	The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typical range between -60 and 0 db.
`mode`      | 	Mode indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0.
`speechiness`        | 	Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks.
`acousticness`| 	A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic. 
`instrumentalness`  | 	Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. “Ooh” and “aah” sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly “vocal”. The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0. 
`liveness`      | 	Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live. 
`valence`        | 	A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).
`tempo` | 	The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration. 
`track_uri`  | spotify track uri
`duration_ms`      | 	The duration of the track in milliseconds.
`time_signature`        | 	An estimated overall time signature of a track. The time signature (meter) is a notational convention to specify how many beats are in each bar (or measure).
`key_mode` | mode of key
`playlist_name`  | name of playlist
`playlist_img`      | image of playlsit url
`track_name`        | name of track
`artist_name` | name of artist
`album_name`  | name of album
`album_img`      | image of album url
`year`        | year of release
